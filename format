description: '"When we can’t explain whats in our head, first we try to do it ourselves.” A solid mantra for Paris-based electronic duo Superparka, who are very much DIY as they produce and record their music and visuals. Their first mixtape Sushi BouBou #1 (I can only assume is named after the Sushi BouBou restaurant in Paris), which was released in April 2018, featured the duo’s lo-fi, garage-house sound, with hits like “GIRL” and “skip” getting some traction with their brand of DIY electro-pop.',

  rating: ['Now, the Parisian pair are set to release Sushi BouBou #2 sometime this year, and have shared the new single “kawabunga!”, as part of the single series from French record label Kitsuné Musique. Glitchy Daft Punk-esque synthesizers, Justice-inspired house melodies, and subtle layers of psychedelic detailing make up the French-house track. It is a colourful and infectious song that effortlessly instills the need to find a dance floor.'],

'Nigerian/Tuareg musician Bombino first held a guitar back in the early ’90s while living in Algeria as a refugee with his family. His fascination with the electric guitar inspired him to learn from videos of Jimi Hendrix and Mark Knopfler , eventually taking formal lessons as a teenager, and going on to become a renown guitarist in his own right. His incredible guitar playing captured the attention of many Western producers including Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys, who helped Bombino complete his sophomore album back in 2013. Since then, Bombino has been touring the world, mesmerizing audiences with his psychedelic, Tuareg sound, and his enthralling talent.',
'Celebrating their ten year anniversary this year, Ottawa alternative rock band Amos the Transparent are bringing their homegrown, folk-infused music to the big stage Sunday evening. The six-piece band are able to create layered, dense songs that fill every inch of space, resulting in lush harmonies, and invigorating alternative folk rock.'
